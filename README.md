# Registration Form

This project is a simple and user-friendly registration form interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed for collecting basic user information. The form includes various input fields with validation rules to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The form layout is styled to center on the screen with adaptable elements for a clean, professional appearance.
- **Validation Rules**:
  - **Name and Surname**: Limited to between 3 and 20 characters.
  - **Email**: Checks for a valid email format.
  - **Phone Number**: Requires a specific format (e.g., 555-555-5555).
  - **Password**: Requires at least 8 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters.
  - **Address**: Free text area for entering address details.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Real-time validation feedback changes the input border color (green for valid, red for invalid).
- **Error Handling**: An alert message displays if any fields are incomplete or invalid upon submission.
